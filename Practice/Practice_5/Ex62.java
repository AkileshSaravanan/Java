/*
Let us output an integer in Java.

Java has a few lines of code which we write in almost all programs.
These are the first 3 lines that you see in the program to your right. (Ignore what those lines mean - we will explain them later)

What matters for now is just Line 6:
System.out.println(12);
This is what we use to output/print anything to the screen.
Every Java statement ends with a semicolon (;)
This code just prints 12 on the screen when you run it.

public class Ex62
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		// your code goes here
		System.out.println(12);
	}
}
